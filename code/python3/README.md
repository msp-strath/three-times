# CS886 Python Basics

In these files we will provide a gentle introduction to programming in Python.
Although CS886 uses both Dafny and Idris,
we recognise that both languages will be new to all students.
The Python code presented here acts as a known base from which students can learning how to program in Dafny and then Idris.
These guides also support a literate style of programming,
using code comments to help describe the code and what bits and pieces mean.

## What is Python.

Python is a multi-paradigm language that supports:

+ Imperative programming using statements and expressions, and is
  effectful (allowing printing and communication with the outside
  world);

+ Functional programming using lambdas;

+ Object Oriented programming using classes that support inheritance;

We can write our programs using any of these paradigms, however, by
default Imperative programming is the norm.

As a language, Python is very rich and supports other functionality.
The purpose of these files will be to introduce common,
and assumed,
programming concepts under the auspices of Python.
We will use the same examples
(where possible)
when introducing programming basics in Dafny and Idris.

## Assumptions

For these files we will assume that you will have some experience
programming, and will be comfortable with imperative languages in the
first instance.

Importantly you will be familiar with:

1. Binding variables to identifiers;
2. Control flow using conditional statements, while loops, for loops;
3. Logical operations on booleans;
4. Working with lists and other data structures;

## The Roadmap

`Imperative.py`
:   Imperative Programming

`Datatypes.dfy`
:   Datatypes and Object-Oriented Programming

## Notes

Python's syntax is indentation based, and requires syntax to be aligned.

Python's comments are:

```{.python}
