title: "Programming Exercises from CS260"
---

These exercises have been adapted from 'CS260: Functional Thinking',
and were originally designed to help novice programmers learn Haskell.

We think these exercises are ideal to help you to revisit your knowledge of Python,
and learn Dafny and Idris.

Please try and complete these exercises using:

+ Python
  + and Python using type hints

+ Dafny the imperative language
  + then Dafny the functional language

+ Idris

To complete these exercises you may need to explore each of the language's standard libraries for any helper functions.

<p class="notice">
You *should not* be required to download any third-party packages to complete these exercises.
