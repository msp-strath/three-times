title: An Introduction

'Three Times' is both a teaching and research project to investigate how best transfer concepts from mainstream programming languages to verification-aware ones.

With
CS886,
we aim to teach secure-by-design programming using two verification-aware language:
Dafny
(a multi-paradigm language)
and
Idris
(a functional language).
Both of these languages are not widely known,
and to enable teaching basic verification in these languages students should also be familiar with how to program in these languages.
Although there are textbooks to engage students,
a more dedicated resource will help reduce the learning curve and fear of going through an existing 'textbook'.
This resource will help students learn how to *programme* in Dafny and Idris.

Both Idris and Dafny are relatively *esoteric* languages,
such that student 'strangeness budgets' will be blown for various reasons.
We assume that many students will have Python(3) as their primary language of instruction/use.

## Assumptions

For these files we will assume that you will have some experience
programming (in Python),
and that you will be comfortable with imperative languages in the
first instance.

Importantly we assume that you will be familiar with:

0. Writing simple methods, calling them too;
1. Binding variables to identifiers;
2. Control flow using conditional statements, while loops, for loops;
3. Logical operations on booleans;
4. Working with lists and other data structures;
