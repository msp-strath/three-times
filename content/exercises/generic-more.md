title: "More Generic Programming"
---

All questions from
[Sequences](/exercises/sequences.html)
can be made polymorphic
(generic)
using the correct application of:

+ higher-order functions;
  and
+ typeclasses/interfaces/traits.

Rewrite your answers to
[Sequences](/exercises/sequences.html),
and make them more generic.
