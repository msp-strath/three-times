Some exercises for working with Sequences.

1.  Write a program called `addOne`,
    that given a list of integers adds one to each element.
    1.  How many times will `addOne` be called on the list `[1,2,3,4,5]`?

2.  This question is divided into two components:
    1.  Write a program which,
        given three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`,
        returns true if:

        $$
        a^2 + b^2 = c^2
        $$

    2.  Write a second program that,
        given a list of integer triples,
        returns all the triples where:

        $$
        a^2 + b^2 = c^2
        $$

1.  Given a list of characters,
    write a program which returns:

    > You're Out!

    if it finds three occurrences of a given value in a list,
    and otherwise returns:

    > all good

    **Hint**
    : you may want to define a helper function.

2.  Write a program that sums the even values of a list of integers.

3.  Write a program that returns `True` if a character occurs twice in a row in a string,
    and False otherwise.

    **Hint**
    :  Strings in Python, Dafny, and Idris are represented differently.

    Now:

    1.  provide a new program that work on lists of strings;
    2.  provide a new program that works on lists of lists;

4.  Without using code from the standard library,
    write a program that computes the maximum value in a list of integers.

    Using your program,
    define a function that sorts a list of integers from smallest to largest.

5.  Write a program that returns the character at a given position in a string.

6.  Write a program that reverses lists of length 2 and leaves all other lists unchanged
