title: "Basics"
---


We began with demonstrating how to
[run programs](/hello.html).
In this topic,
we will look at how we can write basic programs.

Specifically,
we will dive into *basic* programming paradigms looking at:

+ [Bindings](/basics/binding.html)
+ [Expressions](/basics/expressions.html)
+ [Conditionals](/basics/conditionals.html)
+ [Methods/Functions](/basics/blocks.html)
+ [Loops](/basics/loops.html)
+ [Iterations](/basics/iteration.html)
+ [Recursion](/basics/recursion.html)
+ [Sequences](/basics/sequences.html)

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this topic,
for each language,
you will:

1. be able to write simple programs that operate on builtins;
2. be able to write simple programs using various forms of control flow;
3. be able to divide programs into method/functions;
4. be able to write programs using sequences;
